# post-demo 
This app developed in angular 10v.
first need to clone this project. need to "npm install" on your cli.
and then "ng s" put for start to this application.

## Applcation works
you need to first put URL localhost:4200 on your browser. login page will be there. add any admin user credentials,
You will see the page with three tab users, dashboard and posts,
get all the data from jsonplaceholder fake api.

## Post CRUD
you can create post , update post , delete as well.

## Guard implementation 
if you put any wrong routes name , page redirect to login, 
without login we can not go on dashboard page. using as localstorage for temporary.
